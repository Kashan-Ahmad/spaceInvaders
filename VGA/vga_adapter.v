/* VGA Adapter
 * ----------------
 *
 * This is an implementation of a VGA Adapter. The adapter uses VGA mode signalling to initiate
 * a 640x480 resolution mode on a computer monitor, with a refresh rate of approximately 60Hz.
 *
 * This implementation of the VGA adapter can display images of varying colour depth at a 
 * resolution of 320x240 or 160x120 superpixels. The concept of superpixels is introduced to 
 * reduce the amount of on-chip memory used by the adapter. The following table shows the number
 * of bits of on-chip memory used by the adapter in various resolutions and colour depths.
 * 
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Resolution | Mono    | 8 colours | 64 colours | 512 colours | 4096 colours | 32768 colours | 262144 colours | 2097152 colours |
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 160x120    |   19200 |     57600 |     115200 |      172800 |       230400 |        288000 |         345600 |          403200 |
 * 320x240    |   78600 |    230400 | ############## Does not fit ############################################################## |
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * By default the adapter works at the resolution of 320x240 with 8 colours. To set the adapter in any of
 * the other modes, the adapter must be instantiated with specific parameters. These parameters are:
 * - RESOLUTION - a string that can be either "320x240" or "160x120".
 * - MONOCHROME - a string that should be "TRUE" if you only want black and white colours, and "FALSE"
 *                otherwise.
 * - BITS_PER_COLOUR_CHANNEL  - an integer specifying how many bits are available to describe each colour
 *                          (R,G,B). A default value of 1 indicates that 1 bit will be used for red
 *                          channel, 1 for green channel and 1 for blue channel. This allows 8 colours
 *                          to be used.
 * 
 * In addition to the above parameters, a BACKGROUND_IMAGE parameter can be specified. The parameter
 * refers to a memory initilization file (MIF) which contains the initial contents of video memory.
 * By specifying the initial contents of the memory we can force the adapter to initially display an
 * image of our choice.  The image is written into memory when your circuit is programmed into the DE1-SoC board. 
 * Any pixels subsequently coloured by your circuit will overwrite that part of the image.
 * To restore the background image you would have to reprogram the board. 
 *
 * To use this module connect the vga_adapter to your circuit. Your circuit should produce a value for
 * inputs colour, x, y and plot. When plot is high, at the next positive edge of the input clock the vga_adapter
 * will change the contents of the video memory for the pixel at location (x,y). At the next redraw
 * cycle the VGA controller will update the external video monitor. Since the monitor has no memory, the VGA 
 * controller copies the contents of the video memory to the screen once every 60th of a second, which keeps the 
 * image stable.
 *
 * Make sure to include the required VGA signal pin assignments for the DE1-SoC board. Connect the clock input to
 * 50 MHz CLOCK_50 pin.
 *
 * During compilation with Quartus Prime you may receive a number of warning messages related to a phase-locked 
 * loop (PLL), and a message about VGA_SYNC_N being stuck at Vcc. You can safely ignore these warnings.
